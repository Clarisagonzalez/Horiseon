## Description

- This was refactoring project which included starter code from a challenge. The purpose was to make it easier to read and naviagate while not making any big changes to distrupt the code. I faced some challenges when translating the changes on to the CSS sheet. I did learn how to replace non semantic elements with semantic elements, Include alt attributes, and more! 

## Usage
 Shows a cleaner code while still being functional.
